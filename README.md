Wireframing
What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint or layout of a digital product — such as a website or mobile app — before the actual design and development begin.
It focuses on the structure, content placement, and user flow rather than colors, images, or detailed design elements.

A wireframe typically includes boxes, lines, and placeholders to represent navigation menus, buttons, text areas, and other key components of the interface.

Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial early step in the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design process because it helps:

Clarify Ideas: It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize concepts quickly before investing time in detailed design.

Define Structure and Flow: It outlines how users will navigate and interact with the product.

Facilitate Collaboration: Wireframes make it easier for designers, developers, and clients to align on layout and functionality.

Identify Issues Early: By reviewing the structure early, potential usability or navigation problems can be detected and fixed before coding begins.
